# QoderManager

QoderManager is a Windows utility designed to help users bypass Qoder limitations and manage Qoder processes. It is distributed as a standalone executable for ease of use.

## Features
- **Start Bypass:** Resets Qoder settings to bypass restrictions. Automatically closes any running Qoder processes before starting the bypass.

- **Quit Qoder Process:** Allows you to close any running Qoder processes directly from the menu.

## Usage

2. The application requires administrator privileges to modify system registry and files.
3. Use the menu to select your desired operation:
   - **Start Bypass**: Resets Qoder settings to bypass restrictions. If Qoder is running, it will be closed automatically.
   - **Apply Token Limit Bypass**: Removes token limitations for unlimited usage. Requires Qoder to be closed first.
   - **Quit Qoder Process**: Manually close any running Qoder processes.
   - **Exit**: Close the application.

## Notes
- Always run the executable as Administrator for full functionality.
- The tool is intended for use on Windows systems only.
